    We are slowly ramping up our release schedule. Currently trying to learn more about things you, the viewer, are interested
    in seeing from the site (<a href="mailto:info@infinite.industries">all input welcome</a>) and reaching out to artists we know and respect (check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/1nfinite_1ndustries/" target="_new">#featuredartist series</a> on our social media channels).
  </p>

  <p class="text-center">
    Please enjoy the current releases.

  <ul class="artist-listing text-center">

    {% else %}
      <li>Micro-releases of artwork coming soon.</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
